This file just contains some notes to myself about various things.

Checklist for making a new release:

- Run test suite on as many machines as possible.
- Update the version number to the new M.m.r value.
  - README.rst
  - setup.py
  - __init__.py
- Read over the CHANGELOG.rst file and edit as needed.
- Update the wiki pages to incorporate any changes as needed.
- In docs directory, run update_docs
- In gh-pages directory, commit and push new docs.
